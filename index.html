				Syfy's clever fantasy series about the students at (basically) magic
				grad school remains one of TV's most idiosyncratic and subversive shows.
				Entering its fourth season, it often bucks genre and structure tropes to
				deliver an unpredictable adventure in each wild episode.
				There's a reason fans have flocked to the fanciful fantasy of Fillory &mdash;
				and crafty wordplay is just one of them. <cite>(Syfy, Jan, 23, 9 p.m.)</cite>

			<h2>ALL HALE THE KING</h2>
			<p>
				<i>The Magicians</i> never has a dull moment &ndash; one week the spell
				casters may stage a bank heist, the next they may find themselves belting out
				<i>Les Mis</i> on the eve of war. For Hale Appleman (right), who stars as
				theatrical Renaissance man Eliot, the whimsy is part of the charm.
				&ldquo;Anything goes on our show,&rdquo; says Appleman, 33, whose earlier
				credits include <i>Teeth</i> and <i>Smash</i>. His role on <em>The Magicians</em> has seen him rise and fall as high king of
				a Narnia-ish realm. &ldquo;It actually suits me as an actor because I've never
				been one to make truly conventional choices, and in a lot of ways the show opens
				the potential for me to play and color outside of the lines,&rdquo; he says.
				Each year on the show tests Appleman in new ways; this season, he plays
				a childlike monster possessing Eliot's body. &ldquo;On one hand, I missed the
				ease and the comfort I cultivated within Eliot's character, but I also enjoyed
				the challenge of finding something different every week that surprised even
				myself sometimes.&rdquo;

				The drama's fickleness, he says, has only helped him
				grow as an actor. &ldquo;I've been able to learn how to truly stand in my
				confidence and power in my character on set.&rdquo; Long may he reign!
